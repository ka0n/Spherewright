For ordinary2011/2012 sorters, set initialSorterFilterItemId to an unlocked item BEFORE connecting a mixed source: native construction installs the filter before the first pickup, with plannedSorterFilterItemId and final sign/filter readback. Zero means unfiltered; later configuration cannot undo contamination. Exact slots are tried first; one explicitly selected belt segment and an ordinary storage/assembler/lab may use native_single_belt_segment attachment, bounded to64 path intervals without retargeting neighboring belts. Two explicitly selected belt segments may use native_two_belt_segments, each bounded to64 intervals and the whole fallback to64 candidate placement checks, following native destination-then-source projection. This two-belt subset binds both segment geometries; it does not enumerate neighboring belts or rank UI cursor candidates. Inspect plannedInserterAttachment for both slots, positions and signed input/output offsets. Native facing/tilt, span, collision and materials remain mandatory; TooSkew is not permission to relax angles or move existing buildings. For exact-slot failures, nativeChecks counts actual DSP placement checks; read lastNativeRejection before the lastPreNativeRejection of a different slot pair. Neither a passing angle nor an unrelated TooSkew proves the overall placement result. On rejection read the attachment stage, candidateChecks and bestFacingDegrees: geometry_unavailable is not an angle verdict, and candidate checks do not imply native placement checks ran. Do not repeat an unchanged pair; move closer only for explicit OutOfReach. Bound endpoints use endpointStateHash; private segment geometry and offsets are rechecked before commit, while cargo flow alone is not geometry change. Full path checks use an inactive tool-owned stage1 command container, never the player's current anchor-only stage or a temporary edit to player commands. All NEW belt points, including both ends, require more than 0.25 m centre separation from existing built/prebuild belts and other new points; source-only non-removing cover reuse supports a same-grade flat built belt with a free output, one incoming belt at most, and a free destination. A narrow 2001 open-head destination cover also supports an explicit free source (native_grid) or a distinct free belt tail (native_grid or native_geodesic); both complete old paths must be empty and have no external input. Target input slots1/2/3 must all be free. At least two NEW belts are required; both covers stay in full native validation/creation and cost zero. Read destinationBindingMode=non_removing_belt_cover, reusedDestinationObjectId and destinationPreservationMode=empty_open_path_native_geometry_v1. Whole-path evidence is rebound before creation; completion proves exact joined membership, empty cargo, old edges and native rotations. Occupied-input merging, tier replacement, tilted/raised routes and closed paths still reject. Read plannedBeltPath: full_path_stage1, sourceBindingMode, reusedSourceObjectId and newObjectCount; itemBudget/plannedPath count only NEW objects, never either retained cover. Source-cover plans also require sourcePreservationMode=whole_path_native_rotation_v1: native path geometry must prove any completion-time belt rotation change. MCP withholds tokens when this echo is absent or inconsistent. Do not omit endpoint IDs to bypass occupancy or treat topology alone as permission for co-located belts. Belt NotEnoughItem / INVENTORY_INSUFFICIENT requires normal handcraft or transfer, not another site or Move: do not retry with unchanged inventory.
